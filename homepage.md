# Timber Identification CNN

## Introduction
This is the demo for my Final Year Project, it is a timber identification model. The model takes in an input image, then guesses the wood species of the given image.

The model is trained on microscopic wood cross sectional images, from 41 different species.

### Classification Output
After classification has completed, the predictions results will be shown. The header will be the main predictions. There will also be a dropdown, containing more details of the species. Note some species are more well documented than others, so the length of the details will vary greatly.

Below that are the confidence scores of the prediction, arranged in a decenting order
